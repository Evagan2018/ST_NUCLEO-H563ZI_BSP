# NUCLEO-H563ZI Nucleo-144 board

## Overview

The STM32H5 Nucleo-144 board based on the MB1404 reference board (order code NUCLEO-H563ZI) provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build prototypes, by choosing from the various combinations of performance and power consumption features provided by the STM32H5 series microcontroller.

The ST Zio connector, which extends the ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity, and the ST morpho headers provide an easy extension of the functionality of the STM32 Nucleo open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.

The STM32H5 Nucleo-144 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the STLINK-V3EC debugger/programmer.
